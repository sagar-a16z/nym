## [0.2.1] - 2020-05-07

### Changed

- Remove unused Travis CI config
- Polish Cargo.toml

## [0.2.0] - 2020-05-07

### Fixed

- The end of strings is now detected correctly in deserialization (#11)

### Changed

- Strings are now escaped during serialization (#10)
- `from_str`/`from_slice` now work for `T: DeserializeOwned` instead of
  `T: Deserialize<'de>`, making it impossible to deserialize into non-owned
  reference fields. This is necessary since string unescaping requires creating
  a mutated copy of the source data and only JSON strings without escape
  sequences can be deserialized copy-free. The same limitation applies to
  serde_json, where the problem shows up at
  [runtime instead of compile time](https://github.com/serde-rs/json/issues/530).
- Strings are now unescaped during deserialization (#13)

## [0.1.3] - 2020-03-12
